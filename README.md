# DIGITAL-OILFIELD
My first Hackathon project where i worked on making a application which can help you detect leaks , commit works on those leaks which occur on different machines and adding some features which would help in improving efficiency of an oilfiled.

features include alert systems, co2 and weather predication, service dashboard , AI chatbot, Infrared-Sensor Analysis.

#Expanded context of features.
AI CHATBOT= Provides instant, AI-powered support and information retrieval for digital oilfield operations ( USING GEMINI API)
Infrared-Sensor AnalysiS= Leverages infrared data for rapid identification and assessment of oil and gas release incidents.
service dashboard = Predictions for equipment failures before they occur, reducing downtime and maintenance costs as well as scheduling work if required for empolyees.
alert systems= Instant notifications for equipment malfunctions, safety concerns, and production anomalies.
co2 and weather predication= Monitor and analyze carbon emissions and weahter with intelligent reporting tools for environmental compliance.(use openweatherapi)
